# How to test PackageKit (in hasher).
#
# The described way to test has actually been able to expose a crash,
# which happened with some of the changes in APT, but did so only with
# the real Sisyphus indices fetched via network, and there was no crash
# observed when running this test against just the local RPM db in the hasher.
#
# One can first build packagekit with the current APT in hasher (--with-stuff)
# and then test it there with this script or the like.
#
# (The idea could be implemented in an automated test
# required by apt-checkinstall and packagekit-checkinstall.)

# Note that git-bisect(1) expects an "exit with a code between 1 and
# 127 (inclusive), except 125, if the current source code is bad".
# Therefore, I use this script like this:
#
#   git bisect start --no-checkout PK-BAD PK-GOOD
#   git bisect run /bin/sh -exc './gear-build-pair-in-hsh.sh . BISECT_HEAD ../packagekit/ revert-apt-API ~/hasher/; ./test-pk-in-hsh.sh ~/hasher/ || { echo BAD: $?; exit 1; }'
